# UTwente Big Data Group 10
This source repository contains the code for the Big Data course project for the University of Twente by group 10.

The University of Twente has received 66.5 million tweets about the World Cup 2014, one of the biggest sports events in the world.

We will analyse the Twitter user activity based on the time and country of origin of the users. We will detect peaks in activity of these users from various countries and relate these peaks to events from World Cup 2014. We will try to prove or disprove that an increased activity from users of certain countries can be monitored when their country is playing a match or see if some other important event is taking place at that time.

The analysis of the tweets is performed by a large machine cluster owned by the University of Twente. 

> This repository does not contain any tweet data, we only provide a framework to handle the Twitter data!

# Implementation
The implementation is done using an Apache Pig script (i.e. script.pig). The provided data is stored on 667 seperate txt files and formatted in JSON format, which can be read by the Elephant Bird JSON loader.

The data is grouped by country and time periods. The time periods consist of 10 minute chunks. The countries are detected using geo location data (latitude, longitude) if available or twitter's language detection.

The amount of tweets per group are counted. The final output is stored in seperate files. One for each country. This should make it easier to analyse the results.

In our research paper we analyse the results.

# Installation
## Required software
The following software needs to be installed on the machine:
* Apache Pig
* Elephant Bird

## Dependencies
The following libraries are used by the Pig script:
* hadoop.jar (for Elephant Bird)
* pig.jar (for Elephant Bird)
* json_simple-1.1.jar (for Elephant Bird)
* udfs.jar (custom User Defined Function for Country Detection)
* piggybank-0.12.0-chd5.2.1.jar (for storing in multiple files)

# Execution
> *Warning!*
> The script points to the location of the data on our system (i.e '/user/alyr/worldcup/part*.txt'), you will have to alter this to point to the location of the data on your system.
> In addition, the data must be on the Hadoop file system before execution!

The script can be executed using the following command:
```
pig script.pig
```
