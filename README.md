This source repository contains the code for the Big Data course project for the University of Twente by group 10.

The University of Twente has received 66.5 million tweets about the World Cup 2014, one of the biggest sports events in the world.

We will analyse the Twitter user activity based on the time and country of origin of the users. We will detect peaks in activity of these users from various countries and relate these peaks to events from World Cup 2014. We will try to prove or disprove that an increased activity from users of certain countries can be monitored when their country is playing a match or see if some other important event is taking place at that time.
